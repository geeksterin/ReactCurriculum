# Let us define the Rules of the Game

We can’t make a game unless we know the rules. So lets state them here:

- We need a shuffled set of cards. There must be a pair of each card in our deck.
- The game must flip the cards clicked by the player. Maximum of two cards will show at a time.
- The game will handle matched and unmatched cards. Unmatched cards are flipped back after a short duration. Matched cards are removed from the deck.
- Every time a player selects a pair, the game will increment the current move count
- Once all pairs are found out, players sees a confirmation dialog with the score.
  Game provides a functionality to restart.
